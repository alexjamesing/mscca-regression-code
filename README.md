# mscca-regression-code
This repository contains an implementation of multiple sparse canonical correlation analysis regression, as described in the paper. Using this method, multiple data-views can be used to stratify a single data-view (Ing et al. 2019). 
The code implementing this method is written in MATLAB and is extensively commented. We have also included a MATLAB implementation of the two-view sparse canonical correlation procedure originally proposed by Witten et al
(Ing et al. 2019; Witten, Tibshirani, and Hastie 2009; Witten and Tibshirani 2009) (originally released in R).
